=== Stopwords and relevance

The last topic to cover before moving on from stopwords is that of relevance.
Leaving stopwords in your index can potentially make the relevance calculation
less accurate, especially if your documents are very long.

As we have already discussed in <<bm25-saturation>>, the reason for this is
that <<tfidf,Term frequency/Inverse document frequency>> doesn't impose an
upper limit on the impact of term frequency.  Very common words may have a low
weight because of inverse document frequency but, in long documents, the sheer
number of occurrences of stopwords in a single document may lead to their
weight being artificially boosted.

You may want to consider using the <<bm25,Okapi BM25>> similarity on long
fields which include stopwords instead of the default Lucene similarity.
